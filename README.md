### G'day! Welcome to my Github home 👋

I’m Anuradha—I’m and [Software Engineer at CSIRO](https://people.csiro.au/w/a/anuradha-wickramarachchi), Australia. I got my Ph.D. in computer science from the [School of Computing](https://cs.anu.edu.au/) at the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) in Canberra, Australia. I enjoy writing code, playing games and IoT DIYs.

Check out my personal website [anuradhawick.com](https://www.anuradhawick.com).

Check my recent web-site development at [Vinyl.LK](https://www.vinyl.lk/). This is implemented in AWS with Lambda, S3, Cloudfront and Route53! Check repo in [Github](https://github.com/anuradhawick/vinyl-search)   

- 🔭 I’m currently working on clustering TGS sequencing data (binning long reads)
- 🌱 Interested areas include Machine Learning, Bioinformatics and Computational Biology

### Few repo highlights 📸 

I feel quite thrilled about few of my recent work! So decided to showcase here. 😎

#### 🧬 [Long Reads Specialized Binner (MetaBCC-LR)](https://github.com/anuradhawick/MetaBCC-LR)

First long read binner that uses both coverage and composition both in metagenomics binning. Here we introduce a neat trick to estimate read coverage via kmers and build a feature vector for coverage.

#### 🎥 [YOLO Object Annotator for Computer Vision](https://github.com/anuradhawick/Object-Annotation-Maker)

This enables generation of training images for YOLO given a set of objects and backgrounds. Makes life a lot easier as manually annotating real images is labour intensive.

#### 🌐 [AWS Boilerplate (Ready to use with Router)](https://github.com/anuradhawick/aws-lambda-serverless-boilerplate)

This came as a requirement in [Vinyl.LK](https://www.vinyl.lk/). This is a solid template for any AWS lambda based project. All the yaml files and templates are included with sufficient(I hope) help and documentation.
